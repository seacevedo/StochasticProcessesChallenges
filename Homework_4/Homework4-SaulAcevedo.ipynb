    "The nash equilibria in this game is any combination of actions between players such that $s_1 ≤ s_2$ or $s_2 ≤ s_1$, given that $s_1 + s_2$ = 1,000,000. For example, if $s_1$ = 200,000 and $s_2$ = 800,000, these actions are best reponses to each other because neither brother has any incentive of deviating from their bids. If they increase their bids by just 1 dollar, they receive nothing. This would also be the case if $s_1$ = 800,000 and $s_2$ = 200,000. Another nash equilibria would be if $s_1$ and $s_2$ = 500,000, as each brother would receive half and would not have the incentive to increase their bids, otherwise they would receive nothing. Actions in which $s_1 ≤ s_2$ or $s_2 ≤ s_1$, given that $s_1 + s_2  \\neq$ 1,000,000 are not nash equilibria because players can always improve their odds by increasing their bid. For example, if each brother asked for $s_1$ = 200 and $s_2$ = 100, each brother can increase their bid and receive a larger payoff."

    "We can see that the only nash equilibrium in this case is GRIM vs GRIM, as both strategies are best responses to each other. As such, it is best for both players not to deviate from GRIM. The reason for this may be GRIM's unforgiving nature: if one player defects, even by mistake, GRIM will always defect from then on. Therefore, a player may accumulate a higher payoff by simply defecting all the time, since P > S. This means cooperation is costly to a player because if their opponent keeps defecting their accumulated payoff will be smaller than if they had just defected as well. However, since $E(GRIM, GRIM) = E(TFT, GRIM)$, GRIM vs GRIM is a weak nash equilibrium."
